That's the end of my capstone.

I learned a lot this semester, but mostly what not to do in the future when developing
applications for a business. I learned that having lots of little applications is nice,
but ultimately makes for a mess when trying to implement all of the little programs.

To run the application, make sure you have the 32-bit version of microsoft access runtime 2013
installed, and double click the .exe file. The application will start. If you want to filter
data for the analysis, just enter a date and filter.
